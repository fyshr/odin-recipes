        <h2>What is Boerenkool</h2>
        <p>Boerenkool is a traditional Dutch comfort food dish; flavourful mashed potatoes richly green with little specks of cooked kale, served with a side of smoky sausages. It's easy, all cooked together in one pot. This authentic version is also topped with sweet pear halves and a drizzle of their juice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 potatoes</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 bunches of kale (1lb/45ogms/12-14 large leaves), about 8 cups, stems removed, finely chopped, lightly packed</li>
            <li>1 lb (450gms) smoked sausage: rookworst, bratwurst, kielbassa</li>
            <li>¼ cup (115gms) butter</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them in halves (or quarters, if large). Put the potatoes into a large pot. Add the diced onion and the bay leaf and pour the water over the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Cut or tear the kale leaves off the thick center rib, and finely chop the leaves. This works best if you grab a handful of the leaves and kind of press them into a ball, then finely slice them. Once you've got a pile of ribbons on the cutting board, chop the pile again coarsely to cut up the long ribbons into smaller bits. Pile the chopped kale on top of the potatoes in the pot.</li>
            <li>Cut the smoked sausage links into 2 or 3 inch (5-7cm) pieces and lay them on top of the kale. Cover the pot with a lid.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot ingredients to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook everything together until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork and the kale bits are tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the pot, reserving the water. Remove the sausage pieces, scraping off any big bits of kale stuck to them, and put the sausages into the reserved draining water to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add the butter, pepper, nutmeg, and ¾ teaspoon of salt to the potatoes and kale in the pot. Mash them with a potato masher until broken down and well mixed, but the potatoes don't have to be perfectly smooth, removing the bay leaf when you come across it. If you have the kind of potato masher with holes in it, you'll need to scrape out the kale that gets stuck in there. Add enough of the reserved cooking water or milk to moisten the boerenkool if the potatoes are too dry. Taste and add the remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt if it needs it.</li>
            <li>Pile the boerenkool into a bowl or onto a serving platter. Remove the sausages from the cooking water and pile them around the edges.</li>
        </ol>
